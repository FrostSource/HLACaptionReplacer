Before we get into the things I've learned about closed captions in Source 2 I want to recommend at least reading [this wiki article](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Closed_Captions) about S1 captions as it still applies here.

Below is the starting point for every caption file:

    "lang"
    {
        "Language" "MyLanguage"
        "Tokens"
        {

        }
    }

The formatting and spelling are very important for the compiler to read your files.
