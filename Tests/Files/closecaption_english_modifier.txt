<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx! I think that's a Combine fabricator.<sb>Put something in it, I want to see how this thing works.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Now that… will be useful.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Well. That was worth the resin.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx! Did you just inject yourself with something you found on the ground? 
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Aah!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Agh! Headcrab! A headcrab's on your face! Get it off your face, Alyx!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ohhh, it's really on there!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Grab it! Hit it!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hit it, Alyx! Knock it off your face!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh, thank God…
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>It was on your face and it… ugh, it was disgusting.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>ALYX!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx? ALYX!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx? Alyx?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alyx? Alyx, you still there?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>The Combine do know how to upgrade a gun.<sb>I'll give 'em that.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Now that is upgraded.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Ooh, that really worked didn't it? Huh…
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Wow! My gun's looking pretty good!
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh wow, check it out! My gun just keeps getting better and better.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Hmm. I'll tell you what: Let's put that idea on hold for now. We can chat about MY gun when you get back.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Alright. Fair enough. You earned it. I still want those "Russells" back, though.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>You can put that to good use.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of that.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Oh! That should come in handy.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Looking very deadly.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Does it have a skull and crossbones on it?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>That is about as deadly as that thing's gonna get.
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>No, no no no, absolutely not. Why, were you considering it?
<HEADSET><clr:255,255,138>Probably medicine, then.

<clr:255,190,255>Russ, come on. At this point it's kind of "our" gun.
<clr:255,190,255>I don't see one.
<clr:255,190,255>You know, Russ — technically? I don't think there's a whole lot of your gun left anymore.
<clr:255,190,255>Well, Russ, it's official. There is NOTHING left of your gun in this gun. This is just… this is MY gun.
<clr:255,190,255>Agh! Get off! Get off!
<clr:255,190,255>Ah!
<clr:255,190,255>Okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
<clr:255,190,255>Russ! It's on my face! It's on my face, Russ!
<clr:255,190,255>Russ! It's on my face!
<clr:255,190,255>Russ, I know!
<clr:255,190,255>Yeah, it was. I was there.
<clr:255,190,255>I know it's on my face, Russ!
<clr:255,190,255>Yeah. It was.
<clr:255,190,255>I'd never survive a jump from this height.
<clr:255,190,255>Hey, Russell.<sb> I just found a loose syringe of God knows what.<sb>Is this medicine?
